# Part 1: Introduction to R
Spend and hour or so on getting people set up and going through pieces of the introductory code. The goal here is to allow people to gain some familiarity with the programming environment. All non-spatial to start.

### Basic Data Types
Vectors
Dataframes
Lists (if we use them later in the workshop)
Brush over everything else

### Common Commands
Not sure I want to run through this?

### Indexing
?

### String Manipulation
Maybe point it out, since we'll be using it to set file names. A frustrating part of base R. Should I teach stringr?

### Loops
Just for loop and maybe apply statements if doing well on time.

### If/else
Run through this and explain why we'd use logic statements. Come up with example.

### Functions
Nah. Can mention it during the course of the exercises.

### Reading and Writing files
No, we will cover everything we need in the exercises. Maybe don't even include this one? If you keep it, you'll need to update the links.

### SpatialR
No. We will cover all of this later. 

### Add something on dates?
